      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week marks the first time I have ever given any a recommendation on LinkedIn. I know, some people have already been doing this since they are still in university. Why was this considered an achievement for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was very strict in giving recommendation or even references. If my friends/colleagues/bosses ask me if I know anyone who can help, I had to ensure that the one I refer would be very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
