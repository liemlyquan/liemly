<p>From the company stand point, the bus factor of 1 is always dangerous. If there is certain part of your system critical path, is wholly owned by a single person, you know you are doomed. The sky would fall even if this person was to take a long vacation</p>
<p>While the damage for the company is pretty obvious, for the individual, it also has much effect. However, it would take time for one to recognize:</p>
<ul>
<li>It would be harder for you to quit, or simply taking some time off. There would be much more factors you have to think about before making a decision. Work is work, but to some extent, you would not want your beloved product and system, which you have been spending so much time for, being destroyed easily, wouldn&rsquo;t you ?</li>
<li>Your growth stagnate: while it is essential for one to work on a certain system/asepects of a system for long enough to gain some expertise, from the design, development, to operation and scalability, sticky to such for long does not gain you much.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 2 main methods I used to make myself more replacable to the team</p>
<ol>
<li>Documentation: there are multiple documentations I and the team kept at Parcel Perform, including but no limited to:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Onboarding guideline: keep a consistently good experience for every new team member</li>
<li>Technical design: for every EPIC we are having, ensure we have the technical design, and have it discussed through by the team through our Braintrust session</li>
<li>Runbook: how to deal with different types of request, with incidents
Some of the above requires constant update, to ensure that it is not become irrelevant</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Training. No matter how much documentation you provide, it will take some time and practices for the team to replace your position.
Taking on-call as an example. As first, what I attempted to do is to go into all the incidents (which I think may have contributed to my promotion). However, as things going on, this way of working is not sustainatable at all. Due to:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>I cannot always be available, and take care of all the incidents</li>
<li>The team cannot learn and grow
Thus, when there is incident going on inside our team, I usually split them into 3 severity, with 3 different appraoch to handle them:
<ul>
<li>Low: the team do handle that themselves</li>
<li>Medium: I will help, but the team to do the lead</li>
<li>High: I will take the lead, but the team will help
Of course, to make lives easier for everyone after that, a postmorterm and/or a runbook section would always be useful</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
