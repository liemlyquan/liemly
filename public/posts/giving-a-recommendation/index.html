        <p>This week marks the first time I have ever given any a recommendation on LinkedIn. I know, some people have already been doing this since they are still in university. Why was this considered an achievement for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I was very strict in giving recommendation or even references. If my friends/colleagues/bosses ask me if I know anyone who can help, I had to ensure that the one I refer would be very helpful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was not meeting enough people and working long enough. Thus, I did not know how great some people that I worked and have been working with are. Too bad.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I would say giving recommendation feels good ;). We only recommend people whom we find pleasant working with, don’t we ? Hopefully I can be giving it more often :D</p>
