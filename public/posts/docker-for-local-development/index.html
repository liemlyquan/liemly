<p>With traditional method, when I am first on-boarded to a project, I will read through the documentation and install some required software and dependency. However, with Docker, I can simply run a docker-compose command to have everything up and running (err, I just realized we need to install Docker as a requirement). The same case applied for when I am starting a new development session. Of course, one can argue that this setup would be possible even with normal shell script. However, I imagine it would be harder when combining with the next 2 element</p>

<p>We have services which have their own dependent libraries, some of which require specific version. Thus, a requirement on one project could possibly break another. By having a container for each service, we can isolate the services environment, while still allowing them to communicate with each other.</p>

<p>We have people using different OS, with different versions, and we have see no problems with setup on any computer. This would save quite some time for on-boarding, I believe. One more thing is that this would also ensure that our code would be the same across environments. There was a time at Chopp where I run into a problem only on staging and production. After several of hours tracing back, I figured out the problem was with the missing of a library the Docker images. If I used Docker on local environment, (I guess) this bug would have not had happened at the first place</p>

<p>Despite its advantages, There are some weird bugs that I could not know why (yet) when using Docker at local development. Some of the supposed-to-be stable infrastructure services (databases, message queue) went wrong after a restart. I am quite sure that all of these are shut down gracefully, with no weird action, and I was not the only one in the team encountering these bugs. After that, there are some methods that I could do to make it up and running again, with ascending effectiveness</p>
<ul>
<li>Restart the container (less likely works though)</li>
<li>Run docker-compose up force-recreate</li>
<li>Remove the container, and run docker-compose up (actually, I wrote a function for this, since it is much effective than the other 2)</li>
</ul>
