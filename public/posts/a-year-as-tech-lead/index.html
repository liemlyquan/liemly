<p>This hands down is one of the easiest thing I can realize.  Much as I am, as a very active contributor before, it was very quick for me to realize my limit. Instead of being able to spend a full day working on a single problem, I now jumps between multiples. It is then I realized I have to spend more time on coaching and mentoring other team members, making them the knowledge expert, which is a more sustainable than having me jump into and handle everything</p>
