Let go one step back with vacuum. Vacuum is defined as follows VACUUM reclaims storage occupied by dead tuples. In normal PostgreSQL operation, tuples that are deleted or obsoleted by an update are not physically removed from their table; they remain present until a VACUUM is done. Therefore it&rsquo;s necessary to do VACUUM periodically, especially on frequently-updated tables.">

<p>To observe some of the below mentioned queries, you can try running this command when autovacuum is taking place:</p>

<p>As stated from the vacuum, it can help us gain back some of the storage for obsolete data. Note that autovacuum will not always return the storage space back to the disk. However, it will mark the old spaces as available for future insertion, which should slow down the speed of growth.</p>

<p><code>autovacuum {table_name}</code></p>

<p>PostgreSQL relies on transaction&rsquo;s mechanism relies on the transaction IDs. However, transaction ID has a limitation of 2.1 billion. Once that limit is reached, the database Thus, PostgreSQL would need some mechanism to ensure that this limit is not reached</p>

<p>Analyze is an operation to do analysis on a table, from which query planner can make better plans based on the newer statistics. Analyze can be run on-demand, if we know we have just made significant change to the content of table, or it will be triggered by autovacuum</p>

<p>If autovacuum is all good, without any downside, it would have been an easy life for all of us, who are PostgreSQL. However, there is some cavaet coming with us</p>

  Higher CPU/MEM and IOPS

</h3>
<p>The operation does not come without any cost. You will observe higher CPU and Memory usage due to the autovacuum. This will then directly impact the performance of the database during that period.</p>

<p>On the other hands, in certain cases, you may want to accelerate the speed of vacuum (e.g: when transaction ID is too high, when the database is first restore), you may want to do your own vacuum, which will normally far more aggressive than autovacuum itself</p>

<p>Depending on the available resources, we may want to adjust some of the PostgreSQL parameters to fit with your usage patterns. On some of the managed services, e.g: RDS, some of these settings would be auto tuned to some extent, based on your machine computing resource</p>
